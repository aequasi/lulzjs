0.1.6:
  - Added the check for already included files, so the inclusion is avoided.
  - Added the var __VERSION__ that contains the lulzJS version being used.
  - Added the var __PATH__ that contains the paths checked by lulzJS while including a file.
  - The new __PATH__ variable brings on a best practice way of including, by using the root
    directory of the main script as main path, so this means no local inclusions but pseudo
    absolute inclusions.

    Something like:
    main.js
    includes/file.js
    includes/file2.js

    main.js does include("includes/file.js");
    includes/file.js does include("includes/file2.js");

    This is permitted because the interpreter after checking for a local file it checks for a
    program root dir file and then for a system library file.

0.1.5:
  - Replaced the #include statement with 2 Core functions: include and require.
